									Marjan Sirjani is a Professor at <a href="http://www.mdh.se/idt"> School of Innovation, Design and Engineering at 
Malardalen University (MDH)</a>, Vasteras, Sweden. Her main research interest is applying formal methods in Software Engineering.
									She works on modeling and verification of concurrent, distributed, timed, and self-adaptive systems. 
Marjan and her research group are pioneers in building model checking tools, compositional verification theories, and state-space reduction techniques for actor-based models. She has been working on analyzing actors since 2001 using the modeling language <a href="http://www.rebeca-lang.org/">Rebeca</a>. Rebeca and its extensions are designed to bridge the gap between model-based software development and formal analysis, and has been used for analyzing different network and system applications. She has also worked on coordination languages and is the co-author of the paper proposing Constraint Automata as the compositional formal semantics for the coordination language Reo. Her research is now focused on safety and security assurance and performance evaluation of cyber-physical and autonomous systems.  
								</p>
								<p>
									Marjan is the founder and leader of Cyber-Physical Systems Analysis research group at MDH. She was a co-founder of Icelandic Center for Research on Software Engineering at Reykjavik University, and the founder of Formal Methods Laboratory at University of Tehran.
She has been a member of expert panel on Engineering and Physical Sciences at <a href="http://rannis.is/">RANNÍS</a>, The National Icelandic Centre for Research.
									
								</p>
								<p>
Marjan has been the PC member and PC chair of several international conferences including SEFM, iFM, Coordination, FM, FMICS, SAC, FSEN, and DATE.
							She is an editor of the journal of Science of Computer Programming. 
									Before joining academia as a full-time faculty she has been the managing director of Behin System Company for more than ten years, developing software and providing system services. Marjan served as the head of the Software Engineering Department of <a href="http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the University of Tehran from 2005 to 2008 prior to joining the School of Computer Science at Reykjavik in 2008.
								</p>
								<p>
									She established <a href="http://fsen.ir/">FSEN</a> conference series in 2005 with the help of the Steering Committee and support of <a href="http://cs.ipm.ac.ir/">School of Computer Science at IPM</a>.
									<br>
									FSEN has been supported by IFIP WG2.2 and ACM SigSoft.
